# CppProblems

A collection of C++ competition promblems.

Most problems are from [Luogu](www.luogu.com.cn) and [USACO](www.usaco.org). They both follows CC License.

Please pay attention, the code in *!UNFINISHED* is **NOT** tested. Also, my code is **NEVER** the only correct answer. It's important to think by yourself first.

You can see a *!NOQUES* folder in the repo. This is some old questions that I haven't add the question itself. You may search for them.

Please *like* my repo if possible. Have a nice day. :)

Here is a list of all the problems, and a link if there is one. You can easily compare with my code or upload to an OJ to test.
